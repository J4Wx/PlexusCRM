# About PlexusCRM
Plexus CRM aims to be an OpenSource, FreeSoftware solution for Customer Relationship Management.

The application is currently in the extremely early stages of development but is being built with the goal of total modularity. Whilst the core of PlexusCRM is released under GNU GPLv3 developers are free to create and distribute their own, private modules under their own license.
